My solutions for [[http://adventofcode.com/2017][Advent of Code 2017]]

My daily languages are C and Python, but this year I use the opportunity to
learn some *Elixir*. I strieve to write good, idiomatic code, so if you see 
something that could be improved please don't hesitate to open an issue or to
submit a PR.

Thanks :)
