"""
For the first part of day 3 no code needs to be written. Notice how
in the lower right corners you have n^2 (n odd) and in the upper left
corners you have n^2 (n even), each with a distance of n-1.

For your input just find the nearest square, calculate its distance
and take the distance between your input and its nearest square into
account.
